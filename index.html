        <p>A short dive into the hobbies of one particular student at Mtec</p>        
    <h2>What you might not know!</h2>
        <p>I love to spend time with my family.<br/>Even if it can get exhuating sometimes</p>
        <p>Other things I enjoy doing are constructing plastic figuriens, <span> somthing that has definitely not cost me thouasands of dollars...</span> 
            <br/>but regardless of the price it has brought me immense joy</p>
        <p>The most expensive hobbie of mine however has to be driving down to a ranch 
            <br/>in southern Utah and pestering a family into thinking I'm some sort of 
            <br/>Native American shape shifting witch, a &lt;skin walker&gt; if you will</p>
<h3>My hobbies may be strange, but they are fun!</h3>
